/*CPUs with AVX-512
    Why does it take so lang
    Intel
        Knights Landing Xeon Phi processor, 2015
        Skylake Xeon processor, expected in 2016
        Cannonlake Xeon processor, expected in 2017

// BIG BIG todo
// Will eventually support most of these ( hopefully ).
// AVX-512 Foundation – expands most 32-bit and 64-bit based AVX instructions with EVEX coding scheme to support 512-bit registers, operation masks, parameter broadcasting, and embedded rounding and exception control
// AVX-512 Conflict Detection Instructions (CDI) – efficient conflict detection to allow more loops to be vectorized, supported by Knights Landing[1]
// AVX-512 Exponential and Reciprocal Instructions (ERI) – exponential and reciprocal operations designed to help implement transcendental operations, supported by Knights Landing[1]
// AVX-512 Prefetch Instructions (PFI) – new prefetch capabilities, supported by Knights Landing[1]
// AVX-512 Byte and Word Instructions (BW) – extends AVX-512 to cover 8-bit and 16-bit integer operations[20]
// AVX-512 Doubleword and Quadword Instructions (DQ) – enhanced 32-bit and 64-bit integer operations[20]
// AVX-512 Vector Length Extensions (VL) – extends most AVX-512 operations to also operate on XMM (128-bit) and YMM (256-bit) registers[20]
